# Restaurant-Rating-Prediction
We predicted rating of restaurants based on features like type of restaurant type, dishes liked, approximate cost, online order, etc. The basic idea of analyzing the zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurants at different places in Bangalore, aggregate rating of each restaurant is based of factors like location, type of restaurant and many more details. We have performed Exploratory Data Analysis bringing out insights regarding which location has highest number of restaurants, how many restaurants are accepting online orders and so on... Next, we trained 4 models on preprocessed dataset which work to predict the rating of restaurants and performed a comparative study between them.
